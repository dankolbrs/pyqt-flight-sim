# Attitude Indicator #

From wikipedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attitude_indicator

An attitude indicator (ADI), also known as gyro horizon or artificial horizon, is an instrument used in an aircraft to inform the pilot of the orientation of the aircraft relative to earth. It indicates pitch (fore and aft tilt) and bank or roll (side to side tilt) and is a primary instrument for flight in instrument meteorological conditions.
